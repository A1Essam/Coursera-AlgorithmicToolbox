## What is Naive algorithm ?
Naive algorithm is a common sense, obvious and slow solution for the problem.
For example , if we want to find a number in array:
### Naive algorithm : 
#### Linear search.
### Optimized algorithm : 
#### Binary search .

## what is stress testing?
In general, it is a program that generates random tests in an infinite loop,and for each test,it launches your solution on this test
and an alternative solution on the same test and compares the results. This alternative solution you also have to invent and
implement yourself, but it is usually easy, because it can be any simple, slow, brute force solution, or just any other solution that
you can come up with.The only requirement is that it should be significantly different from your main solution.
