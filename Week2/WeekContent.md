## Greatest Common Divisor
The greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of numbers is the largest factor that all the numbers share.
For example, 12, 20, and 24 have two common factors: 2 and 4. The largest is 4,
so we say that the GCF of 12, 20, and 24 is 4. GCF is often used to find common denominators.

#### To compute GCD for a and b
suppose that m = a %b then GCD(a,b) = GCD(b,m).
